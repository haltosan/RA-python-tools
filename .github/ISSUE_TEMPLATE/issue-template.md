Ask any questions you wish to be addressed towards the entire team or submit any bugs/issues with the current software.

If it is a bug, try to answer the following questions:

- What script is the error occurring in?
- What is the exact error message?
- What were you doing when it failed?
- Is it reliant on the network drives? _If it is, keep in mind the drives lose connection about every two hours_
- Do you have any ideas on how to solve it?
