    "This code uses an alternate method of doing NLP. It's useful when the page layout has separate columns of information (ex. student name, home city, address) that are hard to separate in a regular expression if combined on one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use an OCR option that outputs each column entry on its own line -- so unlike the regular notebook, you want it to look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    John Doe\n",
    "    New York City\n",
    "    21 Main Street\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 12 has worked well in the past, but another might be better for a specific source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have OCR in that format, you can write a regex that uses newlines to keep the information separate. On one line, it would be difficult to separate the name and home city (\"John Doe New York City\" -- when does the name stop and the city start?), but the newline gives a definitive break between the two pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The newline character can be included as a character using '\\n'. Another useful trick is putting '^' at the beginning of your expression, which will match to the beginning of a line. '$' matches to the end. (If you're trying this outside this program, make sure to use the re.MULTILINE flag, otherwise it will match to the beginning and end of the entire string.)\n",

    "    4. Make a variable for each column, and set it either to a named capturing group in your regex, or a hardcoded value (if         it's the same for every row, like school or Chetty tier)\n",
