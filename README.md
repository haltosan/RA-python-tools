# RA-python-tools
Tools written in python for file analysis and name extraction.
The main file is 'file analysis.py' which has all the tools I use.
'predicates.py' has predicate functions I wrote to help identify data that is either useful or useless.
Each file has it's own documentation in a block comment, but feel free to yell at me if something doesn't make sense.
