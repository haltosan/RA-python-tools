**See the [contributing](https://github.com/haltosan/RA-python-tools/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to get started and learn the conventions of this Github page.**

The code here is a collection of some tools the team has written to help automate tasks during work. The majority of the tasks involve natural language processing, optical character recognition, and some misc AI.

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/haltosan/RA-python-tools/wiki) for syntax and usage.

The experimental directory is just tinkering around with functions that either didn't work or were only used for a specific use case, and are therefore not that useful.
