# RA-python-tools
Tools written in python for file analysis and name extraction.
The main file is 'file analysis.py' which has all the tools I use.
'predicates.py' has predicate functions I wrote to help identify data that is either useful or useless.
Each file has it's own documentation in a block comment, but feel free to yell at me if something doesn't make sense.



### Usage

Download the latest release and extract the zip. Inside are a few python files. The main file is file_analysis.py (it has all the functions defined). The other files are either exteneded features (experimental) or supporting (predicates). My prefered usage is opening file_analysis.py in IDLE and running it. There isn't any output aside from working directory, but it has all the functions loaded and ready to use from the shell.

Visit the wiki for syntax and usage.

I also have a help video [here](https://youtu.be/f5S-SsI30pw), but the wiki is far more extensive. Reach out if there are any questions.
