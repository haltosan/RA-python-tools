# RA-python-tools

Some tools I have written to help automate tasks during work as a research assistant in BYU's record linking lab.

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/haltosan/RA-python-tools/wiki) for syntax and usage.

The experimental file is me tinkering around with functions that either didn't work or were only used for a specific use case, and are therefore not that useful.
