# RA-python-tools

Some tools I have written to help automate tasks during work as a research assistant. The two main projects in here at the moment are file_analysis.py and LP-OCR.py.

* file analysis is a suite of tools to help with natural language processing and preparing text files for data extraction
* layout parser (lp-ocr) is an optical character recognition project that parses the layout of documents and uses the layout information to do more reliable text extraction

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/haltosan/RA-python-tools/wiki) for syntax and usage.

I also have a help video [here](https://youtu.be/f5S-SsI30pw), but the wiki is far more extensive. Reach out if there are any questions.
