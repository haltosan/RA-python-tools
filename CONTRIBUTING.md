# Contributing

Here are some good practices that should help the Github page be a bit more consistent.

## Project board

Whenever you hear about a new assignment, even if it's just for you, add it to the _TODO_/_In Progress_ section. Whenever you take an assignment out of _TODO_, make sure at least one person is in the 'assignees' section. This way we know who is working on anything at any given time. The deadline column is not always needed, but include one if it helps with timing.

## Code section

Upload anything here that you think could be useful for the other people in the lab. Whenever you do upload a project, make sure to write documentation in the wiki (or in the project itself if it's fairly small). Missing documentation just leads to unusable projects because nobody knows how to use them.

## Wiki

Add anything to the wiki that you feel other RA's could find useful, and add project documentation here. Keep a project's docs to 1 page.

## Questions

Any questions that you wish to address to the entire team, just post in the issues section. This should be used for general questions because the entire team can then look over the conversation. Hopefully this can be a great resource. Please check this section from time to time to make sure people aren't lost on an assignment.

If there are any other questions or questions about contributing, just email me (E.S.).
